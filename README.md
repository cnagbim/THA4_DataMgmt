LMI Solar Rooftop Annual Generation Potential (as a % of Total Residential Potential) - All U.S. County

Description: This layer maps the total Low-to-Moderate Income (0-80% AMI) annual generation potential for rooftop PV as a percentage of the 
total residential annual generation potential, at the County-level. 
Mapping the percent LMI potential provides a better understanding of the relative LMI solar potential opportunities for each county,
regardless of population density. Attributes included in this layer include both percent LMI generation potential and 
percent LMI suitable building count. In addition to these percentage attributes, we provide the total LMI and total residential
values for both generation potential (GWh) and suitable building count, for each county.

The data NREL used to create the dataset was from 2013-2017 American Community Survey

Data Source: Center for Disease Control (CDC), Social Vulnerability Index

Social Vulnerability Index measures a communities resilience and adaptability after a disaster happens.
It is broken down into 4 "theme" areas that are then aggregated to give a total vulnerability score.
That total score is the variable "RPL_Themes". The data that the CDC used to create this dataset is from 2016.

The themes:
1) Socioeconomic status, 
2) Household composition and disability,
3) Minority Status and Language,
4)Housing and Transportation.
The score is a percentile of vulnerability compared to other census tract communities.
A higher score means the community is more susceptible to despair when a disaster occurs.
